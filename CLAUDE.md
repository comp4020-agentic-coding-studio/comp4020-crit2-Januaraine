# CLAUDE.md — Agent Operating Rules

## Stack

- Static site: **Astro + TypeScript**, building to plain HTML/CSS/JS in `dist/`.
- Pages live in `src/pages/` (file-based routing); shared structure lives in `src/layouts/`; global CSS lives in `src/styles/global.css`.
- Deployed as a GitHub Pages project page. CI's link check (`linkinator ./dist`) crawls the flat `dist/` output directly, with no knowledge of the deployed subpath — so internal hrefs/asset paths must stay **relative** (no leading slash, no `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` prefix). This mirrors the previous Vite setup's `base: "./"` convention and is why `astro.config.mjs` does not set `base`.
- Any change must still satisfy — `pnpm build` emits into `dist/`, `package.json` scripts (`check`, `check:evidence`, `build`) keep working, and `dist/` still passes `spec/`.

## Key commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Run the dev server while iterating. |
| `pnpm check` | Runs `typecheck && build && lint (oxlint + stylelint) && vitest run` (includes `spec/`). Must be green before any commit. |
| `pnpm check:evidence` | Validates process evidence (`PROCESS.md` citations, `reflections/`, this file). Run before shipping. |

## Guardrails (mandatory)

### Course base invariants

1. **Dual-viewport check.** Any change touching UI, layout, or CSS must be verified at **both** 1920×1080 (desktop) and 390×844 (phone). Both viewports count in full — do not ship a fix that only works at one size. Use a real rendered view (dev server + browser), not assumptions about the DOM/CSS.
2. **Never commit red.** Run `pnpm check` after every code change. If it fails, fix the failure before committing — do not commit with a failing typecheck, build, lint, or test.
3. **No unrequested API changes.** Keep code modular. Do not change the signature of an existing function/module/export unless explicitly instructed — extend or add new functions instead of altering existing contracts.
4. **Read the failure, don't guess.** When a check fails, the error message names the file/line/contract that's wrong. Fix that specific thing rather than making speculative changes.
5. **Secrets.** Never commit credentials, tokens, or keys to any tracked file.

### Dynamic / project-specific rules

1. **Execution status.** Before starting a non-trivial task, briefly state: (1) what has been completed, (2) what remains, (3) the immediate next action.
2. **Long tasks warning.** If an action is expected to take several minutes, inform the user before proceeding.
3. **English only.** Write all project artefacts in English unless explicitly instructed otherwise — including code comments, Markdown/docs, generated commit messages, and user-facing site content.
4. **Docs location.** Store newly generated documentation in `docs/` (create it if missing) unless told otherwise; reuse existing docs instead of duplicating them.
5. **Protected paths.** Never move, rename, or relocate files whose name or location is fixed by project/assignment requirements (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `PROCESS.md`, `reflections/`, required root-level files).
6. **Plan before large work.** Briefly state the plan before code changes or large documents; for multi-phase work, propose the phases and wait for confirmation; if a request is too large to complete reliably in one run, stop, explain why, and propose a staged plan before implementing.
7. **Resume, don't restart.** If interrupted by an API error, streaming error, timeout, or manual stop, never restart the whole task — inspect existing files/output first, resume from the last completed step, and regenerate only what's missing or incomplete.
8. **Check before creating.** Before creating a file or starting work, check whether a suitable file already exists and whether the work is already partially done; update/reuse it instead of duplicating or repeating work.
9. **Scope large tasks.** Estimate the scope of long-running research or generation tasks before starting; warn the user if it's likely to exceed one context window or API response; prefer smaller, independent stages.
10. **No invented URLs.** Discover website pages from the site's actual navigation or sitemap when analysing an existing site — never guess or invent page URLs.

## Growing this file

Add project-specific conventions here as they're discovered (recurring agent mistakes, stack quirks, new invariants) — keep entries short and actionable.
